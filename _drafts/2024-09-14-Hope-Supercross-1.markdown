After missing out on racing the NZ cyclocross championships I was keen to
find some alternative races to scratch my cyclocross itch. We had a holiday planned
to the UK to see family following the NZ champs race, so I looked for some racing
during our time there. The first two rounds of the Hope Supercross
series in Bradford provided an opportunity to experience racing at a higher-level
than we have in New Zealand, and as expected, to learn a lot.

The first two rounds of the Hope Supercross series were a double-header, and after
a slight adjustment to accommodate the filming of a zombie movie in the original
location, the race took place at Wyke in Bradford. This course was based around
a purpose built road cycle circuit, and the 3km course made good use of the 
small area available.

## The course

The weather had been mostly dry in Bradford leading up to the race and when we 
arrived on Saturday morning we were greeted with a dry and grassy course. The 
course started on the tarmac with a gradual uphill and long right corner which
would provide a nice safe start before the first bottleneck. The course then
headed off onto the grass with a few turns before a set of well-built steps to 
run up. 

After remounting and descending gradually there were a few more turns before
the main technical obstacle of the lap which was a nice pair of up-and-down chicanes
on off-camber. I was embarasingly slow at these turns, which was disappointing, but
probably unsurprising given that I haven't practiced features like that since
Huttcross stopped being allowed to use the stop-banks fully.

After the chicances, the course went through the pits for the first time before
continuing on more fast grassy sections. There were two more slightly technical
sections on the lap, with one long out-and-back off-camber section with a 
switchback on the off-camber at one end, and a small off-camber rutted section.

The course was mostly dominated by high-speeds and lots of short punchy accelerations.
Just before the finish straight on the tarmac were some very well-made hurdles
which should have been simple to hop, but given my nervousness I didn't feel
like trying to hop so committed to running every lap.

During practice I tried to get used to the dry conditions, which were unlike
anything I have raced in NZ, and attempted to get used to the new bike, new tyres
and the bike I was borrowing as a pit bike. All in all, quite a bit for a short
half-hour practice session and I definitely didn't manage to get anything
fully dialled in! 

I settled on running my new Challenge Grifos and foolishly
ran pressures that I had been running in NZ on much stiffer sidewalled tyres and
slower courses (lesson 1 of n). These low pressures and supple sidewalls saw me burp air out of
both the front and rear tyres during the race resulting in four bike swaps.
Thankfully David and Dad handled the swaps perfectly and increased the pressures
in both tyres to around 26psi.

## The race

Start - gridded well on random grid - didn't hold my own, no confidence (lesson 2 and 3)

Tried to hold the wheel, struggled with riding at pace on the wheel (lesson 4)

Start was very fast - I had the power to go with things, but couldn't sustain it (lesson 5 - improve aerobic capacity!) and was loosing lots of time in corners (lesson 6 - skills!)

Worked on passing people, put hurried through turns - hit pedal multiple times (lesson 7) - crashed a couple of times a lap for the first three laps, burped tyres.

Calmed down, settled in, reduced mistakes. Started pushing again, finished strong, but got stopped just before the line to let the leader through for a good finish-line photo.

Finished XX of YY. Disappointed and frustrated, but glad to be going again the next day.

## Thanks

For the weekend in Bradford I was riding my new blue crux that will now be left
in the UK, and a loaned bike from a member of my Scottish families cycling club
(thank you!). My parents, Aunt, Uncle and cousin Jamie all came along to Bradford
for the race as well, but sister Katy was sorely missed after she picked up a bug.

Uncle David has a lot of experience in the pits, having helped Cameron for years,
and it was amazing to have his calm head and help for the weekend. Dad also did pit
duties to help with bike changes (there were a few on day 1!) and did a great job.
Thanks to all my family for their support and help over the weekend.
