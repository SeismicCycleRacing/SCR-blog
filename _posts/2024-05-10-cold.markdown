The last few months have been pretty hectic, so it perhaps is not surprising that I have ended
up getting sick for the first time in four years... Since Karapoti I have been working pretty
hard on building my base fitness after testing showing that my main weakness was my aerobic 
fitness. I went pretty hard on increasing training volume, but I probably did a poor job of
managing my training expectations alongside life, so here I am: feeling sorry for myself and
being frustrated knowing that I am losing some fitness. I also don't know how to recover from
being sick!

For now I'm going to take it easy, keep my riding easy until I lose this cough and my resting
heart rate drops back to pre-cold levels and keep my fingers crossed that the weight I gained
in Alaska (2kg in two weeks!) will fall back off again once I can get back to training.

Also frustratingly it seems less and less likely that my citizenship application will be 
prcoessed in time for me to race national cyclocross champs this year. I will keep training
for it as if I can race just in case, but I think I will need some new goals soon to not lose
motivation.
