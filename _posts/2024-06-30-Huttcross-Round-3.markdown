After a month of solid training I was pretty pooped but excited to see 
how the body would go at round 3 of the Huttcross 2024 in Moonshine Park.
I had committed to the mud tyres this time around, although the forecast 
was good for the race. 

Moonshine is a classic Huttcross venue, and one that
I used to enjoy designing silly off-camber chicanes for back when I was
on the Huttcross committee. Sadly the stopbank is now less used than
Huttcross' early days, partly because we did too much damage to the
bank and the council were (probably rightly) afraid that we might
destabilise the bank.

I rode out to the race with Gav, Sam, Laura and Liam and his dad Jason.
There was a relatively mild northerly headwind for us while we pootled
up the Hutt River trail, and the northerly persisted through the racing.
Thankfully, the longest straight on the course was run as a tailwind section,
so we didn't have to worry too much about the wind.

The course for this round at Moonshine was mostly run at the northern end of
the park, taking in lots of tight turns around the Totara trees, as well as some
nice wider corners and straights around the bigger gum trees. The going was
mostly dry, but with a little slime on top in some sections making for some slick
turns.

When I saw who had turned up for A grade this week I was a little apprehensive
but keen to see how I would go against Liam (who has been getting better with every race),
Callum Kennedy, Caleb Botcher, Ari Scott and Jim Ashley. Jim, Ari and Liam all beat me
at round 2, so I felt like I had a point to prove!

My plan for this race was to try and get a good hard 40 minutes out to mimic the
upcoming National Champs race. I still
haven't had my NZ citizenship come through, so I won't be able to race 
the elite race at the NZ national champs this year and the master race is only 40 minutes long.
I also knew that my legs were not feeling fresh and I didn't expect to have much real
sustained top end but I wanted to challenge myself to push good power for the ~1 minute
flat straight section on the stop bank.

I got a good position on the front row again for this race along with all the hitters.
The three of us Cal* riders (Callum, Calum and Caleb) were together with me in the middle.
From the gun Callum leaned on me and I leaned on Caleb but thankfully I edged out in front 
of them. Into the first corner, Jim was leading with me in second. We both took quite different
lines as I tried to get more flow through the corners while looking for the overtake.

After a few turns I managed to get around Jim and tried to open a gap before the twisty section
through the Totara. I didn't feel like I ever got the corners through here particularly well
and ended up using this section as a chance to recover rather than getting frustrated.

Out of the twisty section I had a small gap of a few metres to the rest of the pack and
decided that the gap was large enough that I could kick away without taking everyone with me on the open section. I jumped up to 800W then tried to hold 450W the rest of the way along the stop bank. This seemed to open the gap a bit more.

From there I set about kicking where I
could and recovering through the twisty sections where I didn't think I would be losing much time. I made a few mistakes in the middle of the race which lost of a few seconds, but managed
to pull myself back together before the end. In the end I took the win by just over a minute
with fairly consistent lap times. On the last two laps I could really feel my glutes screaming
at me while I tried to keep getting out 420W along the stop bank. It still baffles me that
friends in the UK can do 400W at threshold...

This was a good fun race and a nice confidence boost that the training is doing useful things.
I'm looking forward to now starting some 'cross specific work for the next two blocks before
national champs, and then racing in the UK, where I look forward to getting my head kicked in
by some really good riders!
