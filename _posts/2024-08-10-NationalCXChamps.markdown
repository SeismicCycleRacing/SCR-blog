## Background

This years National Cyclocross Championships race was hosted by Southern Cross CX
in Christchurch, with the race held at the Motukarara Raceway. I took the win in
the M30 category, which was cool, but not what I wanted. This race was always
going to be frustrating for me, and I ended up adding a few more frustrations
with a sub-par performance. 

I feel pretty silly being unhappy with a win at the national champs, but there
is a reason for it: I wanted to be racing the elite race. The start of this post
is a bit of a ramble about why I couldn't race elite. To see the race report skip
on to [race report](#race-report).

There is one condition to being able to race elite at the national
championships: you have to be a New Zealand registered rider. To be registered as an 
NZ rider you need to be an NZ citizen. I have lived in New Zealand for 12 years
now having moved over to do my PhD in September 2012, but I haven't yet been 
granted citizenship. 

The road to getting citizenship is fairly long and you (generally) have to go through two residency
visas (temporary then permanent) before being eligible to apply for citizenship.
Being a PhD student does not count towards the time requirements for this process, so the 
clock started in 2016 when I graduated. I then went through the work-to-residency scheme which 
took another couple of years, then had to wait to get permanent residency, before finally being 
eligible for citizenship.

I became eligible to apply for citizenship in early 2023, but I had an altercation with a car driver 
resulting in them running me over resulting in a police investigation which further
delayed my application until August 2023.
Since then (12 months ago) my application has been sat in a queue and has yet to be seen.
Hopefully I will get citizenship in time for next years champs race, but there is
no guarantee.

When I put my application in, the expected timeline for processing citizenship 
applications was less than a year so I was hopeful that I would be able to race.
I then set about training to target this race. Before this year I hadn't been able to train
consistently because my research usually requires me to spend
a couple of months in the field without a bike, and doing long days meant that
I lost fitness and motivation. I was finally in a position to hand off field responsibilities
to other members of my group and focus on training for a year. Don't get me wrong:
I love my fieldwork, but I still feel like I have things I want to do racing bikes.

        Fieldwork in the Southern Alps is awesome, and it is even better when I 
        get to do it with Emily - here I got to fly in and dig a hole for Emily 
        while deploying the SALSA array.

Over the last year I have put a lot of work in and have seen my fitness steadily
improve (apart from one bout of sickness) and I have really enjoyed it. However, in
April I checked in on my citizenship application and had the realisation
that time had run out for getting my citizenship and changing nationality with the
UCI. I was unsurprisingly pretty gutted by that: it felt like the thing I had
been working towards had been taken away from me before I even had a chance to
show what I could do, even though there was never any guarantee that the process would
happen in time.

After being glum for a few weeks and generally being miserable to be around (sorry Emily)
I decided to refocus and still go to national champs and try and learn from the 
experience: particularly I wanted to ride hard and compare myself to the elites 
to see what more I had to do. I don't know if Emily realises quite what impact she had when
she told me to just think of how much fitter I could be next year - little does she
know what plans I have now! I also had the opportunity to plan to do some racing 
around seeing family in the UK, so I changed my training to target those UK 
races rather than national champs.

So: I found myself not peaking for national champs, racing in the M30 category
about five hours earlier than the elite race, and hoping to learn something 
from the experience.


## Race Report

Enough grumbling!

The course at Motukarara was a good one: a nice mix of grinding
power sections, fiddly slippery turns and a solid run-up. All up, I think the
course suited higher powered riders rather than those with high power-to-weight,
which is always good for me as I am not light!

I flew down to Christchurch the day before the race and hadn't given myself time
to pre-ride on that Friday, so had an early start planned for Saturday to practice
before the 8.45am cut off, with my race starting at 10am. Unfortunately I didn't 
get much sleep on that Friday night, and hadn't had good sleep all week with a sinus 
issue after that seems to be a follow on from the fever caused by my latest COVID booster.
This lack of sleep meant I was pretty fatigued come Saturday resulting in my heart rate
being about 10bpm higher than usual for a given power during the roll out to the race. 
I then wasn't able to get my heart rate up high either: I topped out at 168bpm 
during the race when I would usually be up closer to 180bpm, and max out around 192bpm.

Being a nationals race we had a proper call up to the line and had our tyres
checked for width. I got called up first and lined up in the middle on the front row.
Vaughan lined up next to me. Vaughan and Simon back in Wellington had been 
telling me that there might be some stiff competition and I was looking forward
to getting to race people.

I got a good clean start, but didn't go all in from the line so that I could keep
an eye on the other riders. Vaughan stomped it off the line and I settled in next 
to him for the first few hundred metres. Vaughan entered the first corner first, then
somewhere in the next section I took the lead and set about pressing on the pedals
out of the corners. When I looked back a few seconds later I saw I had a good gap
already. From there on I was on my own.

I settled in to the rest of the lap, riding hard, but never really attacking
out of the turns like I have been through the rest of the season: looking at my
power for the first lap I was consistently exiting corners at around 500-600W, 
way down on my usual 900W kicks. In hindsight I was a little demoralised that 
it had been easy to get a gap, and while I told myself that I should be pushing 
on I never really did. Given my HR and health, I probably didn't have those top
powers really either.

There were a few technical sections on the lap that required a bit more focus,
The first being a spiral on grass after we got off the raceway bog. The spiral
was particularly slippery in our race and I never really got it as well as I 
wanted. After that was a boggy stretch across the grass, with a drainage channel
that wanted to sap your speed. In hindsight that would have been a simple hop to
save energy and maintain speed rather than flopping into the soft stuff!
This was followed by a short section of gravel access
road leading into a grassy and slightly rocky section with a deep bog at the top.
I was riding the bog all race, but always wondered if it would have been faster to
run.

Coming down from the bog we went over some rocks, and with my tyres at 20psi for
grip on the slippery sections, I was picking my line carefully and not going 
full noise to avoid damaging tyres or rims. We then rolled through the pits and
turned left then right into the run up. I was pretty happy with how I ran this,
and my dismounts and remounts were good, but there wasn't much grip up the run up
and foot holes hadn't really formed yet, so I was taking very short strides and
couldn't run full speed. This was consistently where my heart rate got to its
max value for the race though, so I was clearly pushing myself a bit up here, but
still couldn't get out of tempo HR.

After remounting and tackling a tight and slippery 180 degree turn, we had a 
nice fast section along the top of the bank with a slight wiggle. In that wiggle
there was a root that I hit my rim on on the first lap, to avoid damage I slowed and avoided it on 
subsequent laps. We then turned hard-right onto the descent back down to the 
"arena". This ended with "carnage corner", a long left-hander with limited grip.
This was pretty slippery for the morning races, but seemed to improve during the day.
I was quite cautious through this and probably lost quite a bit of time playing it safe here,
but I had no good reason to pin it.

The corner continued into the pair of hurdles. I still haven't got the
confidence in my bunny hops to be hopping in races, so I took a tight line and
ran the barriers every lap. Again, I was happy with my dismounts and remounts,
so that was a positive for the race, but it was cool to see Craig (Elite winner)
hoping right up until the last lap. It was clearly faster to hop.

We then entered the final section of the lap which was a series of chicanes on
slippery grass. I rode these on the first lap, but felt like I was losing a lot of
speed. I then slipped out and crashed on one corner on the second lap. The lack
of traction also meant that I wasn't able to push hard through here which I found
frustrating given that my heart rate was generally low. I thought that I could go
faster, push more, and be more consistent if I ran the corners and uphills and
rode the descents between corners, so I did this from lap 3 to the end.

After lap 2, I could see that my gap on Hisky was fairly stable, and looking at
the lap times I was only gaining about 10s every lap on Hisky. For context, at Huttcross
I have been quite a bit faster than Hisky, so either Hisky was riding great, or
I was on a bad day! I decided that my lead was safe enough and that I would just try
to ride clean consistent laps from here on in. At no point was I close to my limit,
but I don't think I had much motivation to push more. 

In the end I came through to finish about 1 minute up on Hisky who took the M3 class (50+?) and
about 4 minutes up on Vaughan, who was second in my category.

It was great to spend the rest of the day watching the other races, but I was
pretty frustrated watching the elite race and not being part of it. I don't know
how I would have done, but I don't think I would have won! Comparing laps
on strava it looks like I was losing more than 20s a lap on the sections that
were very slippery in the morning, but improved during the day. The rest of the
time that I lost I think was probably lost by not kicking out of the turns. I like
to think that I would have been able to challenge some of the elite racers, and hopefully I 
will get to prove it to myself one day.

Next up is the final Huttcross round this Sunday. If I'm feeling good for I
hope to go hard at and try and find my limit, but at the moment I am still a 
bit under the weather after the week of bad sleep last week, so I might have to just
take it easy. After that I have a bone graft scheduled to fix some damage in my 
jaw from a bike accident 18 years ago. Hopefully I will recover from that 
quickly and be ready to go for some racing in the UK in September!
