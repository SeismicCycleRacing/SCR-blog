For the final round of Huttcross 2024 the weather forecast was promising
some very wet conditions. We were back to Moonshine for a second
time and although I committed to riding out, I knew that I wouldn't want to ride
home after the ensuing cold mudbath, so I was thankful that Emily offered to 
pick me up. The ride out was a good indication of the weather to come with 
some heavy downpours soaking me before I even got to the venue: I need to 
re-waterproof my jacket after a winter of weather and washes!

The course for this round was quite different to the previous Moonshine course and
the organisers had done a great job at mixing things up despite the need to
reuse a venue. This time around the course had some long drags on the grass
that ended up being a proper slog in the wet conditions. We also dropped down to
the river at the south end of the course, but thankfully we weren't using the
long run along the river gravels that has ruined bikes and shoes in the past.
In general the course wasn't very technical, and especially at the speeds that we
were able to achieve in the rain. With those low speeds the corners were all 
straightforward and the lap was long for a Huttcross lap.

I forced myself out for a warm up just as another band of torrential rain came through.
Thankfully the rain wasn't that cold, but I still chose to wear my fleecy
3/4 length tights and arm warmers which did help keep some warmth while soaking
wet. A good sized field despite the rain lined up for A grade, with some fun 
fancy dress being worn by some (I failed at getting my fancy dress ready 
which is probably a good thing given that last time it involved face paint 
which is not well suited to rain).

I got off to probably my worst start this year having selected a gear that 
would have worked well in the dry, but led to me just wheel-spinning and 
standing still on the filth. That put me down in about 8th spot off the line 
into the first corners which meant I got to have some fun overtaking through the
early corners including just hopping off and running around people to get up to
second. We were then onto the long drag south where I just dug in and rode hard.

Coming into the race I wasn't feeling good again. I still hadn't gotten on top
of sleep and wasn't feeling very motivated. I was glad though that my heart rate
was back to behaving normally, and once I got going the body responded well.
As I pushed on on the long drag south I was getting good power out and getting
my heart rate up to the high 170s. Getting traction was a constant battle, so
I spent a lot of time sat right on the back of my saddle trying to keep as much
weight on the rear tyre as possible while letting the front do what it wanted 
through the slop.

I got a good gap on that first drag south and decided to just keep pushing on.
I was still frustrated after my poor showing at nationals the week before and
wanted to try and make my body work now that it was back to being responsive.
For the rest of the lap I continued to try and work hard and ride smooth, not 
that riding smooth was really that possible in those conditions, and the only
way to keep moving forwards was to ride hard. I quite like these conditions,
they really embody the "it doesn't get easier you just go faster" idea: I
don't think it would have been any easier to go slower through that slop, so
I just went as fast as I could.

The rest of the race went by much the same, although the southerly picked up 
around lap 3 which dropped the speeds a bit. Combined with fatigue and continued
deterioration of the course, my later lap times slowed a bit. I was partly
glad that the organisers stopped the race after 5 laps, although that did mean
my race was only 45 minutes long. It made sense to get people off a little
early given the conditions, and with a lap taking close to 12 minutes for some
people, the people that I hadn't quite lapped ended up closer to an hour.

And just like that, the CX season in NZ is over for me for another year. This was
definitely my best CX season yet, and I have been doing it a while now (see video
below for a bit of 2011 Moonshine). I'm now looking forward to two UCI CX races
in the UK in September and a Gravel World Series race the week after before
a week completely off the bike. I'll then be back to NZ and back to some less
structured training leading up to the Whaka 100 and Edition Zero Gravel.
