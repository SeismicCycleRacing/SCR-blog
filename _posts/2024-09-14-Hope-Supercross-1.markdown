After missing out on racing the NZ cyclocross championships I was keen to
find some alternative races to scratch my cyclocross itch. We had a holiday planned
to the UK to see family following the NZ champs race, so I looked for some racing
during our time there. The first two rounds of the Hope Supercross
series in Bradford provided an opportunity to experience racing at a higher-level
than we have in New Zealand, and as expected, to learn a lot.

The first two rounds of the Hope Supercross series were a double-header, and after
a slight adjustment to accommodate the filming of a zombie movie in the original
location, the races took place at Wyke in Bradford. This course was based around
a purpose built road cycle circuit, and the 3km course made good use of the 
small area available (e.g. it was very compact with a lot of cornering!).

## The course

The weather had been mostly dry in Bradford leading up to the race and when we 
arrived on Saturday morning we were greeted with a dry and grassy course. The 
course started on the tarmac with a gradual uphill and long right corner which
provided a nice safe start before the first bottleneck. The course then
headed off onto the grass with a few turns before a set of well-built steps to 
run up. 

After remounting and riding down a gradual descent there were a few more turns before
the main technical obstacle of the lap which was a nice pair of up-and-down chicanes
on off-camber. I was embarasingly slow at these turns, which was disappointing, but
probably unsurprising given that I haven't practiced features like that since
Huttcross stopped being allowed to use the stop-banks fully.

After the chicanes, the course went through the pits for the first time before
continuing on more fast grassy sections. There were two more slightly technical
sections on the lap, with one long out-and-back off-camber section with a 
switchback on the off-camber at one end, and a small off-camber rutted section.

        start tarmac. Slightly more difficult than they look.

The course was mostly dominated by high-speeds and lots of short punchy accelerations.
Just before the finish straight on the tarmac were some very well-made hurdles
which should have been simple to hop, but given my nervousness I didn't feel
like trying to hop so committed to running every lap.

During practice I tried to get used to the dry conditions, which were unlike
anything I have raced in NZ, and attempted to get used to the new bike, new tyres
and the bike I was borrowing as a pit bike. All in all, quite a bit for a short
half-hour practice session and I definitely didn't manage to get anything
fully dialled in! 

I settled on running my new Challenge Grifos and foolishly
ran pressures that I had been running in NZ on much stiffer sidewalled tyres and
slower courses (lesson 1 of n). These low pressures and supple sidewalls saw me burp air out of
both the front and rear tyres during the race resulting in four bike swaps.
Thankfully David and Dad handled the swaps perfectly and increased the pressures
in both tyres to around 26psi.

## The race

There were 42 entrants for this race, with a few pros, and a few riders over from
Europe. The gridding was done based on UCI points, then other rankings, then
randomly. I was lucky to get called up fairly early, gridded around the top 25.
I got off to a clean start, but was very conservative and didn't push. I
felt like I had a lot to learn, and I didn't really know what my body was going
to be able to cope with.

Along the start straight I lost a few places (should have gone harder at the 
start: lesson 2), then bailed out of some overtaking opportunities rather than
taking the places that I could have had (lesson 3: elbows out!). 

The race soon strung out into one long line, and I felt physically fine holding 
the pace, but kept letting gaps open by not quite following the lines of the people
in front: lesson 4 - trusting peoples wheels at flat out race pace requires a lot
of confidence and quick reactions! 

The concertina effect was also strong
which meant that I was sprinting out of every corner and there was no way that
I had the aerobic fitness to sustain that (lesson 5: need to be stronger aerobically).
Nevertheless, once the gaps did open a bit I was still losing time in the corners
just not holding the speed that the others around me seemed to be able to 
(lesson 6: work on high-speed dry CX cornering!).

6 lessons to be learnt from just the first half a lap! 

I was getting a little frustrated in the second lap and started to rush some 
of the mildly technical sections which led to more
mistakes, mostly clipping pedals on off-camber sections or out of corners 
(lesson 7: patience). These mistakes led to be crashing a few times for over the 
first few laps, which burped my front, then rear tyre. Thankfully uncle David
had borrowed a bike from someone in his club (thank you!) and I got to practice
swapping bikes.

Eventually I calmed down, and David had used his sense to up the pressures in my
tyres to a more secure pressure. From about half-way on I started to feel like
I was properly racing rather than just making mistakes and recovering. I started
to be able to catch a few people and was pushing on right up until what I thought
would be my penultimate lap. Sadly just as I was coming to the line I was pulled 
aside to let the leader come through to finish his race. He was about 15s behind 
me at that point, so I was a bit disappointed not to get to finish on the same lap
and maybe make up a few more places, but that's racing.

In the end I finished 33rd out of 42 starters, about seven and a half minutes 
(1 lap at my pace) down on the winner Thomas Mein. I came away quite frustrated
and disappointed that I hadn't been able to race cleanly in front of my family.
Despite that, or perhaps because of it, I was raring to go for the next days
race to try and put into practice some of the lessons learnt in the race. Some
of those lessons needed more time (getting fitter...), but I was looking forward 
to having another go.


## Thanks

For the weekend in Bradford I was riding my new blue crux that will now be left
in the UK, and a loaned bike from a member of my Scottish families cycling club
(thank you!). My parents, Aunt, Uncle and cousin Jamie all came along to Bradford
for the race as well, but sister Katy was sorely missed after she picked up a bug.
It was wonderful to have so much family around and to be able to make a weekend
out of my selfish racing schemes.

Uncle David has a lot of experience in the pits, having helped Cameron for years,
and it was amazing to have his calm head and help for the weekend. Dad also did pit
duties to help with bike changes (there were a few on day 1!) and did a great job.
Thanks to all my family for their support and help over the weekend.
